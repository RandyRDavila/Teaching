 - Semisupervised Learning
 - Feasibility of Learning
 - Measuring Error

**Supervised Learning**
 - Linear Regression
 - The K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
 - Decision Trees and Regression Trees
 - Gradient Descent & Logistic Regression
 - The Perceptron Learning Algorithm
 - Neural Nets
 
**Unsupervised Learning**
 - Clustering 
 - The K-Means Clustering Algorithm
 - Hierarchical Clustering
 - Probabilistic Clustering 
 - Autoencoding 



## Prerequisite Programming Languages 
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) versions 3.6 and higher 
- [Julia](https://julialang.org/) versions 1.0 and higher
